# Sample models for the PhysiCell grammar / rules paper

## Getting started
### Windows users
Note: these instructions are written for Linux/MacOS systems.
For Windows, the commands may need to be adjusted.
In particular, the path separators need to be changed from `/` to `\` and the `./project` executable updated to `project.exe`.

### How to run the models
To  use any of these models:
1. clone or download this repository
2. from a terminal, navigate to the repository directory
3. run the model-specific commands to load the model and run the simulation

Generally, the commands are given by:
``` sh
make load PROJ=<project_name> && make && ./project
```
where `<project_name>` is the name of the project directory in `user_projects`.
Some of the models have multiple configuration files, requiring a second argument to specify the desired configuration file:
```sh
make load PROJ=<project_name> && make && ./project <path/to/config>
```
where `<path/to/config>` is the path to the desired configuration file, typically `./config/<filename.xml>`.

### Viewing the results in PhysiCell-Studio
Finally, [PhysiCell-Studio](https://github.com/PhysiCell-Tools/PhysiCell-Studio) can be used to interactively explore the model results.
First, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/PhysiCell-Tools/Studio-Guide/blob/main/README.md#installing-and-running) to download the studio.
After starting the simulation (the call to `./project`), you may immediately open a new terminal and run the following command:
```sh
python <path/to/studio/bin/studio.py> -c <path/to/config> -e ./project
``` 
where `<path/to/studio/bin/studio.py>` is the path to the studio executable (located in the studio directory in `bin/studio.py`).
The config and project arguments are optional, with studio defaulting to `config/PhysiCell_settings.xml` and `./project`, respectively.
Navigate to the `Plots` tab and use the GUI to explore the model results.

## Model 1: Modeling the progression of hypoxia in a metastatic tumor ([link](user_projects/hypoxia))

### Description: 
The model represents oxygen-dependent tumor growth, incorporating mechano-feedback mechanisms and hypoxia-induced cell migration.

### Sensitivity Analysis
A local sensitivity analysis was performed on 24 parameters associated with the cell hypothesis rules to evaluate their impact on the model's behavior. [View the analysis script](Sensitivity_Analysis/SA_script_ex1.ipynb).

## Model 2: Fibroblast-mediated invasion of neoplastic cells ([link](user_projects/epi_caf_invasion))
### Description:
The model represents the interactions between neoplastic cancer cells and fibroblasts in the context of cancer invasion.
Two scenarios are considered: a coculture experiment and one based on patient samples.

For the coculture experiment, use the `PhysiCell_settings_coculture.xml` configuration file.
In that file, set the `<cell_positions>` element to set the desired initial cancer:fibroblast ratio.
The options are located in `config/ics/coculture`.

For the PDAC condition, two samples are provided in `config/ics/`: `PDAC01` and `PDAC02`.
Each of these has an associated `cells.csv` and `substrates.csv` file setting initial conditions for the cells and substrates, respectively.
To run the model with one of these samples, set the `<cell_positions>` element in `PhysiCell_settings_PDAC.xml` to the desired `cells.csv` file and also set the `microenvironment_setup//options//initial_condition` to the desired `substrates.csv` file.
Note: these XML locations can both be found in the file by searching for `PDAC`.

Finally, these simulations take longer to run than many others in this repository.
Each of the two configuration files saves output to a specified folder.
Thus, if you run the coculture, for example, on two different ratios, the second run will overwrite the first.
Plan accordingly!

### Load and run simulation:
```sh
make load PROJ=epi_caf_invasion && make && ./project ./config/PhysiCell_settings_coculture.xml
```
```sh
make load PROJ=epi_caf_invasion && make && ./project ./config/PhysiCell_settings_PDAC.xml

## Model 5: Tumor-associated macrophage and EGFR signaling example ([link](user_projects/tam_egf))
### Description:
The model represents the interactions between tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), incorporating the effect of EGFR signaling in tumor growth and motility.

Three hypotheses are tested: EGFR signaling increasing (1) tumor growth, (2) tumor motility, and (3) both.
These correspond to the three config files and the three rules files with filenames ending with `_grow`, `_go`, and `_go_and_grow`, respectively.

Furthermore, the cell initial conditions are provided in `config/cells.csv`; and with CD4+ T cells are in `config/cells_with_cd4s.csv`.
For the desired hypothesis, change the config file (e.g., `PhysiCell_settings_grow.xml`) to use the desired cells file in the `<cell_positions>` element.

Finally, systemic therapy is controlled via a `<user_parameter>` in each of the config files.
Set this to one of `IFN-gamma`, `IL-4`, or `none` to simulate the effect of the respective therapy.

### Load and run simulation:
```sh
make load PROJ=tam_egf && make && ./project ./config/PhysiCell_settings_grow.xml
```
```sh
make load PROJ=tam_egf && make && ./project ./config/PhysiCell_settings_go.xml

## Model 6: PDAC immunotherapy example ([link](user_projects/pdac_therapy))
### Description:
The model represents the interactions between the tumor and the immune system in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), incorporating the effect of immunotherapies.

The model includes initial conditions representing 16 different samples, each treated with one of eight therapies representing any combination of GVAX (`GVAX`), nivolumab (`ICI`), and urelumab (`URU`).
These 128 files are located in `config/ic_cells/` and follow the naming convention `PDAC_TISSUE_<number>_<therapy>.csv` where `<number>` is a sample index and `<therapy>` is one of `GVAX`, `GVAX_ICI`, etc.
To run the model with different samples and therapies, change the `config/PhysiCell_settings.xml` file inside the `<cell_positions>` element to the desired file.

## Model 7: Neuro development example ([link](user_projects/neuro_dev))
### Description:
The model represents the formation of the laminar structure of the cortex, incorporating asymmetric division of a progenitor layer and migration of neurons to form the cortical layers.

Two configuration files are included to represent two regions of the cortex: the somatosensory cortex (SOM) and the auditory cortex (AUD).

### Load and run simulation:
```sh
make load PROJ=neuro_dev && make && ./project ./config/PhysiCell_settings_SOM.xml
```
```sh
make load PROJ=neuro_dev && make && ./project ./config/PhysiCell_settings_AUD.xml
```
